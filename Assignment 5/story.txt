Movie : Minions

Minions, the fictional yellow cute, funny creatures had one or two eyes. Spoke Minionese. Had the goal to serve the most despicable master. Nevertheless,
they always end up killing their boss. They served Dinosaurs, to Caveman, to the Humans. After mistakenly killing their human boss, they ran away to an 
ice cave. They waited there and formed their civilization. After one point in time, they fed up. Kevin volunteered and asked companions to join. He wanted
to step out and search for the boss. Only a small minion Bob was enthusiastic. Stuart's friends mischievously made him volunteer. They set out and had
their share of difficulties. Ended up reaching Villain Con. There they were selected to serve the greatest Villain. Unfortunately, they messed up again 
but, eventually saved the nation. Evil Villain still stole the crown and was stopped by Gru a child. Ultimately they found their new boss.

Overall the movie was epic. Every inch of the movie seems lovable. Audience survey represents the females accounted for 56 per cent, 44 per cent being 
male, a whopping 65 per cent was under the age of 25. Kids and parents alike went for the movie. Bob was my favourite character.
